4.16.0
======

AxoSyslog is binary-compatible with syslog-ng [1] and serves as a drop-in replacement.

We provide [cloud-ready container images](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#container-images) and Helm charts.

Packages are available in our [APT](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#deb-packages) and [RPM](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#rpm-packages) repositories (Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Fedora).

Check out the [AxoSyslog documentation](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/) for all the details.

## Features

  * New `$PROTO_NAME` macro: add a $PROTO_NAME macro that expands to "tcp" or
    "udp" depending on the transport used by syslog-ng.
    ([#724](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/724))


## Bugfixes

  * Fix memory leaks during configuration parsing
    ([#755](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/755))

  * `grpc` based destinations: Fixed a race condition around `syslogng_output_grpc_requests_total` metrics
    ([#754](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/754))

  * `$PEER_PORT`: fix the value for the PEER_PORT macro, as it was incorrectly
    reversing the digits in the port value, port 514 would become port 415.
    ([#724](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/724))

  * `google-pubsub()`, `logscale()`, `openobserver()`, `splunk()`, and other batching destinations: fix slowdown

    The default value of `batch-timeout()` is now 0.
    This prevents artificial slowdowns in destinations when flow control is enabled
    and the `log-iw-size()` option of sources is set to a value lower than `batch-lines()`.

    If you enable `batch-timeout()`, you can further improve batching performance,
    but you must also adjust the `log-iw-size()` option of your sources accordingly:

    `log-iw-size / max-connections >= batch-lines * workers`
    ([#753](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/753))


## FilterX features

  * `str_strip()`, `str_lstrip()`, `str_rstrip()`: new string transformation functions to remove leading/trailing whitespaces from a string
    ([#745](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/745))


## FilterX bugfixes

  * `in` operator: fix crash, that happened, when the list was declared as an operand

    Example:
    ```
    if ("test" in ["foo", "bar", "test"]) {
      $MSG = "YES";
    };
    ```
    ([#759](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/759))

  * `parse_cef()`, `parse_leef()`: Renamed some parsed header fields.

    **These are breaking changes**

    The motivation behind the renaming is that these names were too
    generic, and there is a chance to find them in the extensions.

    `parse_cef()`:
      * `version` -> `cef_version`
      * `name` -> `event_name`

    `parse_leef()`:
      * `version` -> `leef_version`
      * `vendor` -> `vendor_name`
      * `delimiter` -> `leef_delimiter`
    ([#748](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/748))


## Other changes

  * The base of the AxoSyslog container image is updated to Alpine 3.22
  ([#758](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/758))
