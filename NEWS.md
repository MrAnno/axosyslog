4.11.0
======

## Features

  * `webhook()`: headers support

    `include-request-headers(yes)` stores request headers under the `${webhook.headers}` key,
    allowing further processing, for example, in FilterX:

    ```
    filterx {
      headers = json(${webhook.headers});
      $type = headers["Content-Type"][-1];
    };
    ```

    `proxy-header("x-forwarded-for")` helps retain the sender's original IP and the proxy's IP address
    (`$SOURCEIP`, `$PEERIP`).
    ([#524](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/524))

  * `network()`, `syslog()` sources: add `$PEERIP` and `$PEERPORT` macros

    The `$PEERIP` and `$PEERPORT` macros always display the address and port of the direct sender.
    In most cases, these values are identical to `$SOURCEIP` and `$SOURCEPORT`.
    However, when dealing with proxied protocols, `$PEERIP` and `$PEERPORT` reflect the proxy's address and port,
    while `$SOURCEIP` and `$SOURCEPORT` indicate the original source of the message.
    ([#523](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/523))

  * gRPC based destinations: Added `response-action()` option

    With this option, it is possible to fine tune how AxoSyslog
    behaves in case of different gRPC results.

    Supported by the following destination drivers:
      * `opentelemetry()`
      * `loki()`
      * `bigquery()`
      * `clickhouse()`
      * `google-pubsub-grpc()`

    Supported gRPC results:
      * ok
      * unavailable
      * cancelled
      * deadline-exceeded
      * aborted
      * out-of-range
      * data-loss
      * unknown
      * invalid-argument
      * not-found
      * already-exists
      * permission-denied
      * unauthenticated
      * failed-precondition
      * unimplemented
      * internal
      * resource-exhausted

    Supported actions:
      * disconnect
      * drop
      * retry
      * success

    Usage:
    ```
    google-pubsub-grpc(
      project("my-project")
      topic("my-topic")
      response-action(
        not-found => disconnect
        unavailable => drop
      )
    );
    ```
    ([#561](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/561))


## FilterX features

  * `set_pri()`: Added new filterx function to set the message priority value.

    Example usage:
    ```
    set_pri(pri=100);
    ```

    Note: Second argument must be between 0 and 191 inclusive.
    ([#521](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/521))

  * `set_timestamp()`: Added new filterx function to set the message timestamps.

    Example usage:
    ```
    set_timestamp(datetime, stamp="stamp");
    ```

    Note: Second argument can be "stamp" or "recvd", based on the timestamp to be set.
    Default is "stamp".
    ([#510](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/510))

  * `cache_json_file()`: inotify-based reloading of JSON file
    ([#517](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/517))

## FilterX bugfixes

  * `switch`: Fixed a crash that occurred when the selector or case failed to evaluate.
    ([#527](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/527))


## Notes to developers

  * editorconfig: configure supported editors for the project's style
    ([#550](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/550))

  * We have clarified the meaning of the required "Signed-off-by" line in commit messages
    ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

  * Light, AxoSyslog's lightweight end-to-end testing framework is available as a PyPi package:
    https://pypi.org/project/axosyslog-light/

    It allows you to extend the framework and the test suite out-of-tree (licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later).


## Other changes

  * `azure-monitor()`: unified destination

    The `azure-monitor-builtin()` and `azure-monitor-custom()` destinations are deprecated in favor of `azure-monitor()`.
    `azure-monitor()` requires the `stream-name()` option instead of the table name.
