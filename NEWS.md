AxoSyslog is binary-compatible with syslog-ng [1] and serves as a drop-in replacement.

We provide [cloud-ready container images](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#container-images) and Helm charts.

Packages are available in our [APT](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#deb-packages) and [RPM](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#rpm-packages) repositories (Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Fedora).

Check out the [AxoSyslog documentation](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/) for all the details.

## Features

  * `cisco-parser()`: Added support for Cisco Nexus NXOS 9.3 syslog format
    ([#713](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/713))

  * `loggen`: Added `--client-port` option to set the outbound (client) port
    ([#709](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/709))


## FilterX features

  * `format_xml()` and `format_windows_eventlog_xml()`: new functions added

    Example usage:
    ```
    $MSG = format_xml({"a":{"b":"foo"}});
    ```
    ([#684](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/684))


## FilterX bugfixes

  * `metrics_labels()`: Fixed a bug where `update_metrics()` did not omit `null` values.
    ([#711](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/711))


## Other changes

  * `syslog-ng-ctl stats prometheus`: show orphan metrics

    Stale counters will be shown in order not to lose information, for example,
    when messages are sent using short-lived connections and metrics are scraped in
    minute intervals.

    We recommend using `syslog-ng-ctl stats --remove-orphans` during each configuration reload,
    but only after the values of those metrics have been scraped by all scrapers.
    ([#715](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/715))
