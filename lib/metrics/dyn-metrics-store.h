/*
 * There is a recurring inconvenience with dynamic counters.
 *
 * Registering, changing and unregistering a counter makes it orphaned,
 * as no one is keeping it alive. Non-dynamic counters do not have this
 * issue, as they are always stored on their call-site, binding their
 * lifecycle to the call-site.
 *
 * This class intends to solve this problem by providing a store,
 * which keeps alive its counters until the store is freed. On the
 * call-site you only need to keep the store alive, to keep the
 * counters alive.
 *
 * It also grants a label cache for performance optimization needs.
 *
 * Note: The store is NOT thread safe, make sure to eliminate
 * concurrency on the call site. If you need a cache that is purged only
 * during reload, use metrics/dyn-metrics-cache.h.
